/**
 * Lookback is a relation of tuples (q,R) where q is state and R is a rule from grammar and
 * tuples of (p,x) where p is state and x is symbol. Basically it's a relation on state and rule
 * with state and symbol.
 *
 * Let's imagine that state Q contains final item A -> x <*> where x is a sequence of terminals and
 * nonterminals. That means we need to perform production of rule A -> x and reduce x on the stack
 * into A. That also means that there is some state P with item B -> a <*> A b through which we had to
 * go into state Q. If it happens then (Q, A -> x) lookbacks (P, A).
 *
 * To put it simply, in order to get to state with final item A -> x <*>, we first had to go through
 * state with item B -> a <*> A b. We just simply put state with item A -> x <*> and rule A -> x into relation
 * with the origin state with item B -> a <*> A b and symbol A.
 *
 * This is useful for so-called propagation of lookaheads. If we know that rule A -> x is being used
 * and it all originated in certain state where rule B -> a A b is being processed, we can use what
 * can possible follow A in B -> a A b to know whether to use production of A -> x.
